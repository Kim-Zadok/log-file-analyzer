7. Purpose & Scope

- Aggregate threat intel: Collect, parse, and correlate data from multiple feeds/platforms.
- Enhance investigations: Provide visualization tools and search for fast, precise threat hunting.
- Support action: Automate reporting and exporting of findings for SOC operations.

2. Repository Setup
1. Repository Name:  
   `soc-threat-intel`

1. README.md:

   - Project overview and feature list.
   - Tech stack details.
   - Setup, deployment, and use cases.

1. Folder Structure:  
   /src (Backend and frontend by module)
   /backend
   /frontend
   /docs (Guides, diagrams, API docs)
   /tests (Test suites)

1. .gitignore:  
   Based on primary backend language.

1. Collaborators:  
   Invite as necessary.

1. Tech Stack Overview

- Backend: Python (FastAPI/Flask/Django); Node.js as alternative.
- Frontend: React.js with D3.js or Chart.js for data visualization.
- Database: Elasticsearch for fast searches; PostgreSQL for structured data.
- Caching: Redis (optional).
- Feed Integration: API parsers for MISP, OTX, Recorded Future, etc.
- DevOps: Docker, CursorAI CI/CD pipeline.

4.  Essential Features

- Threat Feed Ingestion:  
  Automated collection from open-source and commercial feeds.

- IOC Search & Correlation:  
  Fast search across millions of indicators; links and patterns.

- Visualization:
- Attack timelines and trend graphs
- Indicator linkage and threat clusters

- Automated Reports:  
  Customizable, exportable analysis for stakeholders.

- Export for Compliance:  
  Output relevant threat data for audits.

- Security:  
  OAuth2 or JWT authentication, HTTPS.

5. Detailed Implementation Steps
1. Repository Initialization

- Set up repository and README.
- Create folders as shown above.

2. Local Environment Setup

- Clone and install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).

3. Develop Key Features

- Feed Parsing Module:  
  Build backend service for fetching/parsing feeds.
- Search Interface:  
  Frontend interface for querying IOCs and viewing correlations.
- Elasticsearch Integration:  
  Index threat data for performance.
- Visualization Components:  
  Use D3.js/Chart.js for building graphs and relationships.
- Automated Reporting:  
  Backend scripts to summarize and export findings.

4. Authentication & Security

- Implement user login/roles using OAuth2 or JWT.

5. Testing & Documentation

- Develop integrated test suites.
- Document all endpoints, modules, and user workflows.

6. Compliance/Export

- Enable CSV/PDF downloads of relevant findings.
- Automate benchmarking against compliance frameworks if needed.

7. Iterate & Collaborate

- Frequent pushes, use issue tracker, and code reviews via pull requests.

6.  Collaboration & Progress Management

- Track tasks and bugs via CursorAI issue tracker.
- Review code through pull requests and gather peer feedback.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation for users and developers.
